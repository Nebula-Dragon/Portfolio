Hi, I'm Alex Elliott, aka Nebula Dragon. I'm a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Leeds.
This GitHub repository serves as my portfolio for various personal projects, old and new. At least until I get a website.

My personal projects can be found in the 'Personal' folder, along with descriptions, history, and some of my thoughts. My academic projects are held elsewhere, but links to them can be found in READMEs in the 'University' folder, again along with descriptions, history, and my thoughts.
