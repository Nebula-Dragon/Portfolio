Blender has been an interest of mine for a while. I first picked up the program sometime in 2013 after being impressed by animations on YouTube. After a few initial online tutorials I decided they weren't really teaching me how to use the program more than they were just teaching me how to create one specific thing, so instead I decided to learn by doing and work on a big project. I really loved spaceships, and at the time I was super into the game FTL: Faster Than Light, so decided to recreate the game's starting (2D) ship in 3D. This was a total 'drop in the deep end' experience for me where I tried to create a complex 3D model from two 2D reference images and a very basic understanding of the software, and it involved huge amounts of trial and error and googling. Frankly I'm amazed young me had the patience for it, but after six months I finally finished. Some renderings later I decided to extend the project and texture the ship, another activity where I knew nothing about how to do it and learnt through failure. I later then decided to also animate the ship, add sound effects, add particle effects, and finally create a full animated video with all of it. It took an extremely long time and was equally full of essentially bashing my head against the software until I figured out what did what, but I eventually did all of it. 

The final video can be found in the Animation folder, or here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EckS-y46Wxg
The models for it all can also be found in the Models/The Kestrel folder, here are some example images:

I was very proud of doing all this and I wanted to do more with Blender. Around this time I started to move away from FTL though, so I didn't do any more on that front. It's place would be taken by Team Fortress 2. Blender projects were the first creative thing I did regarding that game. One of the communities started hosting a 72 hour jams, of which I participated in two, in 2015 and 2016. They allowed all sort of creations, including creating cosmetics for the game (a lot of TF2's actual conent is created by the community in fact). In the first jam I created a pait of crazy 70's style glasses, and inthe second I created three 80's era items: a brick phone, a Rubik's cube, and a floating Pacman. The files for these models as well as them paired with the game's characters can be found in Models/Team Fortress 2, here are some example images:

While these aren't the most impressive from a modelling point of view, and wouldn't have ever made it into the actual game, the act of making them felt quite rewarding. Making them under a great time pressure and knowing they'll be made public straight afterwards produced a different work atmosphere than what I was used to, but in the end I felt like I'd done well. The more professional modellers had made a lot better stuff, but I was happy that I was able to work under the pressure and come out the other side with something finished to show for it. Plus, participating the second time netted me a nice little medal in-game.
