Although my university taught me all I know about the theory of computer graphics, most of the practical content was done with Vulkan. There was some limited use of OpenGL, but it was in the very old version 1. Hence, after graduating, I thought it would be good to learn the modern version of it myself. To do this, I used the website learnopengl.com, a very useful learning resource which I had sometimes referred to before when doing Vulkan exercises (since OpenGL and Vulkan are both made by the Khronos Group and thus share many underpinnings in their methodology).

Although what I'm practically making here isn't very impressive, and I already learnt the theory previously, doing this is teaching me a useful skill in knowing another graphics API, as well as allowing me to compare how it works to Vulkan and also reinforcing said theory.
