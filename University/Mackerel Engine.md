The 'Mackerel Engine' was the final group project I did for my masters year. It involved creating a working game engine, including rendering, lighting, physics, game logic, entity systems and everything else that could be used to make actual video games with.
This was a major project that lasted a whole semester. In my group of six we planned what we would create, researched what it involved, then programmed different parts in sub-groups and finally wrote the documentation. We ended up getting 73/100, which is a 1st class.

More to be written.
