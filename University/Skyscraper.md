This was a graphics project, the most major piece of coursework for the computer graphics module. It involved creating a complex scene in OpenGL, which used C++. The scene I created was a city plaza scene with a skyscraper in the middle, consisting of pavement, road, decorations and moving objects. Seen here:

The scene makes full use of simple and complex objects, lighting, textures, animation and user interactivity. Many elements also respond dynamically to changes in other parts of the scene, such as position of the pavement and the car when the road's width changes, or the speed of the lift when the tower changes height.
