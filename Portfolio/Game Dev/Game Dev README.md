I have contributed to a few game dev projects in a few different roles. None of these projects were on my repositories, so this folder will just contain links to them.

Please note that for some reason my account encountered a problem and GitHub forgot all my contributions to these projects. 
My name is still visible in the commits but it does not link to my profile (or any profile). I have no idea why this is.
