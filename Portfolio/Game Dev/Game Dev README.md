I have contributed to a few game dev projects in a few different roles. None of these projects were on my repositories, so this folder will just contain links to them.

Please note that for some reason my account encountered a problem and GitHub forgot all my contributions to these projects. 
My name is still visible in the commits but it does not link to my profile (or any profile). I have no idea why this is.

Story game project: https://github.com/0rang/story_jam

This project was done for a story game focused jam and I did it with two friends. I wrote up a game script in the weeks beforehand, others did other artistic aspects like art and music, then when the jam started proper we all began coding. My job was creating the levels, which I designed and then created in the game with a tileset. Though we never finished the game on account of university restarting, I think we managed to have a focused project for the time it was active.
