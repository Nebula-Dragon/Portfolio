I have contributed to a few game dev projects in a few different roles. None of these projects were on my own repositories, so this folder will just contain links to them.

Story game project: https://github.com/0rang/story_jam

This project was done for a story game focused jam and I did it with two friends. I wrote up a game script in the weeks beforehand, others did other artistic aspects like art and music, then when the jam started proper we all began coding. My job was creating the levels, which I designed and then created in the game with a tileset. Though we never finished the game on account of university restarting, I think we managed to have a focused project for the time it was active.

My GGJ profile tracks everything I've done in those jams. I have participated twice, in 2020 and 2022. In 2020 it was my (and my team's) first attempt at a full game project, so the result isn't very impressive because we didn't much know what we were doing. I did some level design, story, and character programming, but ultimately there isn't much to show. The most recent jam this year went a lot better and we made a much more impressive product in my opinion, seen here:

2022 Game Jam project: https://github.com/lFirsl/Hunter-Huntee

This project is actually a complete game and works reasonably well, with fully developed levels, player controls and enemies (including a boss fight). This time I focused a lot on level design and development, the resulting two levels were made entirely by me. The workflow was a lot better in this jam; despite being in a bigger team we were a lot more coordinated, putting in more hours and being more productive in them, as well as succesfully managing a Git repository for all of us. Me and another team member also wrote up a story but it was never used. Oh well.
