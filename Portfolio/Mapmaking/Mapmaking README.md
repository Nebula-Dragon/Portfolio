I have quite a big amateur interest in level design and map making. While I have done this work for game dev projects (as can be seen in the game dev section), 
I also have this project that is my own and independent from a wider project. In this case, I have been creating a map for my favourite game of all time: 
Team Fortress 2. Valve generously gave out a lot of their own development tools to the community and this has resulted in a huge content creating community for TF2. 
One of these tools was their own in-house mapping software Hammer, included free with the game. 

It's very complex and professional, but over a few months I had been learning it (with the help of community tutorials) and embarked on a project to make my own proper 
map, the files of which you see here. It's nowhere near finished, but I've found that I greatly enjoyed the process. Currently only the map geometry, textures and props 
are in place, there is still game logic, lighting and sound to do before it's a minimum viable product. I will post updates here as I develop it, after which I fully 
plan to get feedback on it from the TF2 mapping community, and improve on it some more.

Here are some screenshots of the map within the Hammer editor:
