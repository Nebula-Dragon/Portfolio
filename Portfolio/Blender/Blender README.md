Blender has been an interest of mine for a while. I first picked up the program sometime in 2013 after being impressed by animations on YouTube. After a few initial online 
tutorials I decided they weren't really teaching me how to use the program more than they were just teaching me how to create one specific thing, so instead I decided to
learn by doing and work on a big project. I really loved spaceships, and at the time I was super into the game FTL: Faster Than Light, so decided to recreate the game's
starting (2D) ship in 3D. This was a total 'drop in the deep end' experience for me where I tried to create a complex 3D model from two 2D reference images and a very basic
understanding of the software, and it involved huge amounts of trial and error and googling. Frankly I'm amazed young me had the patience for it, but after six months I 
finally finished. Some renderings later I decided to extend the project and texture the ship, another activity where I knew nothing about how to do it and learnt through 
failure. I later then decided to also animate the ship, add sound effects, add particle effects, and finally create a full animated video with all of it. It took an 
extremely long time and was equally full of essentially bashing my head against the software until I figured out what did what, but I eventually did all of it. 

The final video can be found in the Animation folder, or here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EckS-y46Wxg
The models for it all can also be found in the Models/The Kestrel folder, but here are some example images:

I was very proud of doing all this and I wanted to do more with Blender. Around this time I started to move away from FTL though, so I didn't do any more on that front.
It's place would be taken by Team Fortress 2, which I will put info on later.
